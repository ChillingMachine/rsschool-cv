### About me:
I want to gain new knowledge and prove myself well in order to expand the range of specialties in which I could develop.
My strengths: desire to learn, a little experience in learning CSS and HTML.

#### I don't have much experience in programming, so I offer an example of an assignment I solved on <a href="https://www.codewars.com/join?language=javascript">Codewars.com</a>:
```
function multiply(a, b){
return a * b;
}
```
### My background:
I have no background in programming. My main specialty is a lawyer.
My level of English is approximately A2.
